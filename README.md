As a security expert and developer with Global Rain, I understand the importance of providing safe and effective software solutions to protect both the customers and the assets of Artemis Financial. By building programs with the latest security measures in mind, we as software developers can ensure the online banking application is protected against any threats or attacks. In terms of client needs, Artemis Financial requires an elevated level of software security to protect the sensitive financial information of its customers. This will include protection against hacking attempts such as data compromises, and unauthorized access to their systems.
Based on the vulnerabilities identified through the static testing a software threat mitigation plan for Artemis Financials software will include the following:


1. Implement a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure that only authorized users have access to the application and its data.

2. Implement input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and command injection.

3. Encrypt sensitive data both in storage and while in transit using strong encryption algorithms and secure communication protocols such as HTTPS.

4. Implement effective error-handling mechanisms to prevent information loss and other security issues. Provide error messages that do not disclose sensitive information and ensure that errors are logged and reported to administrators.

5. Secure the RESTful API used by Artemis Financial by implementing proper access controls, rate limiting, and input validation.

6. Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents and unauthorized access attempts. Monitor logs and alerts for suspicious activities and take appropriate action in case of a security breach.

7. Regularly update and patch the software and its dependencies to address known security vulnerabilities.

8. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any potential security issues.

9. Train and educate all employees on the importance of security awareness and best practices, including password hygiene, phishing awareness, and data protection.

10. Have a documented incident response plan that includes steps for containing, analyzing, and mitigating security incidents and restoring normal operations.
